## content

### FLIP PG
contains the PG FLIP https://www.dropbox.com/s/sp91zf63rx0esao/FLIP_GULFR2_EC1.pdf?dl=0 

### FLIP CA
contains the CA FLIP. All pages are identical to the ones that come with Caucasus, **except** that the numbering was changed to be consistent with all other kneeboard pages. Be advised, due to limitations in OvGME, you need to run the `clean.bat` file in Mods\terrains\Caucasus\Kneeboard with **ADMINISTRATOR** permissions. This will delete the standard FLIP pages. You can restore them by repairing DCS.
