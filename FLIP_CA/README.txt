CA FLIP Kneeboard
This contains the standard FLIP that comes with the Caucasus map, but fixes the ordering with the 132nd custom kneeboard pages. 
ATTENTION: Due to limitations in OvGME, you need to run the `clean.bat` file in Mods\terrains\Caucasus\Kneeboard with ADMINISTRATOR permissions. This will delete the standard FLIP pages. You can restore them by repairing DCS.
